This website is based on Angular, has Firebase Authorisation and saves user data and bookmarks to the Firestore database.
I used the https://jikan.docs.apiary.io/#/ API 

I wanted to make an angular page for quiet some time now and i finally did it. This is my first angular project, and it took me about 80 hours to complete. I ran in to some issues on the way but i managed to overcome most of them.
