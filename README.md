## Development
### Start
When i was thinking about what i wanted to do for this assignment, i was checking out the newest releases for the next season of anime on MAL, when i realized, that i could make something similar to MAL, with less functionality but better design. I started to design the UI in Adobe XD and started to think about what kind of framework or language i wanted to use. I always wanted to try to make an angular project, so that's what i did, although it wasn't as easy at first. There were some basic things that i had to learn first, so i made some small projects before committing to this one.

### Dev

The development process itself was still not as smooth as i wanted it to be, but that's part of the learning experience. The ui stuff wasn't that much of a problem, and i got it done pretty quick. I wanted to get most of the visual stuff out of the way asap. The authentication feature, took some time, but it helped me understand firebase better. Bookmarking Animes wasn't as easy as i thought it would be, because i had to make multiple things work together smoothly. The routing and the other basic feature were't as much of a challenge as the other two things that i mentioned before. 

### End 

I'm glad that i chose to make my project with something that i didn't know at all, because it makes me prouder, that i made this without almost no prior knowledge. I like the idea of just trying something out and sticking with it even if it seems hard sometimes. 
## Pages
### Home
The landing page itself is nothing special i wanted to keep it as clean as possible and not display any information here. You can use the navigation links, the search bar or the login button to start your journey.

### Top Anime

This Page shows the top 50 entries out of different categories sourced by MAL. It's pretty self explanatory once you see it. I decided to provide some basic info while keeping is as short as possible. If the user decides to click on one of the animes, he will be directed to the detail page of the chosen anime, where he will get more information about it.

### Seasonal Anime
On the seasonal page, the user can provide a year or month based on his preference, which will result in a list of the animes and movies that aired in the chosen period. A click on one of those will also lead to the detail page. The information provided on this page should be enough to decide if an anime peeks your interest or not.

### Schedule

The schedule page is also self explanatory, as it just states which of the currently airing animes, airs on which day.

### Profile

If a user decides to register, he will get a profile page where he can change his name and profile image. Registered users can also bookmark animes that they like and edit the list on their profile page.

### Search

The search function just provides a basic method of looking up specific animes, that the user might be interested in.
